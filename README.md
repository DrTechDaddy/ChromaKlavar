# ChromaKlavar
Create a musical score in alternative "Chromatonnetz-Klavar" notation as an HTML-CANVAS webpage.

This site is not a score editor, more of an "SDK" consisting of examples and code resources
to create your own score webpage.

- You can start with a MIDI file, then run a utility that converts the MIDI file into a spreadsheet,
- or define the score from scratch as the spreadsheet version of a MIDI file. 
- Included Excel macros can convert the spreadsheet .csv file to a list of javascript function calls.
- This function list is then embedded into an HTML-javascript template which you can customize.
- Your "score"  will be an HTML file with embedded javascript that "draws" the staff and notes onto an HTML5 Canvas workspace.
- The score can then be viewed or printed as a normal webpage in a web browser.

This project was undertaken as a "proof of concept" in 2015.
I do not intend to develop it further into a "production"  version,
but I plan to explore conversion to .svg vector graphics.

All software is "as-is" without any warranty whatsoever.

Jan 2022-- I am now activating this stub and adding sample project files.
